A simple cost management app in which users can input their expences and incomes so that users can monitor their financial status and view reports.

App can be seen live at: https://django-wallet-app.herokuapp.com/

* loading initial currency data to database:
    python manage.py loaddata currencies.json

In this project I have experienced:
    * Deploying a Django app on Heroku.
    * Using a tree model for the hierarchical category data.
    * Implementing a category system in which users can add, delete or edit categories.
    * Using Bootstrap's modal dialog boxes for user experience improvement.
    * Working with branches on git.
    * Writing tests.
