A simple cost management app in which users can input their expences and incomes so that users can monitor their financial status and view reports.

App can be seen live at: https://costmanagementapp-production.up.railway.app

* loading initial currency data to database:
    python manage.py loaddata currencies.json

In this project I have experienced:
* Deploying a Django app on Heroku and Railway.app.
* Using a tree model for the hierarchical category data.
* Implementing a category system in which users can add, delete or edit categories and sub-categories.
* Using Bootstrap's modal dialog boxes for user experience improvement.
* Working with branches on git.
* Writing unit tests and integration tests. Using mocks and patch.
* Using Django contenttype framework.
* Writing commit messages in Conventional Commits style.
* Writing custom template filters.
