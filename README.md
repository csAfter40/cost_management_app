A simple cost management app in which users can input their expences and incomes so that users can monitor their financial status and view reports.

* loading initial currency data to database:
    python manage.py loaddata currencies.json

In this project I have experienced:
    * Deploying a Django app on Heroku.
    * Using a tree model for the hierarchical category data.
